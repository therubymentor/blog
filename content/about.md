# About me and the company

## Me

I have used many different languages and technologies over the years as a web developer, but lately the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language and a combination of [Rack](http://rack.github.io/), [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/), and even [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) have been my tools of choice, usually combined with the awesome JavaScript library, [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

I live between San Diego and Puerto Vallarta depending on the weather and my mood. Sometimes I feel like a nut, sometimes I don't.

## Technology Education

[RubyMentor](https://rubymentor.io) was founded in 2015 after spending 3 years rescuing Rails projects, and then another year helping developers figure out what ails them at [CodeMentor](https://codementor.io), where I am the #1 Ruby Mentor.

So for 5 years I have been exposed to some of the ugliest code Ruby has ever known. I have refactored some scary shit. I have untangled the tangliest pasta code you can image, and I have decoupled code that was brittle and impossible to test. I tend to focus on Test Driven Development to tease out and test functionality in an isolation style.

I now mentor students daily using tools like [Flowdock](https://flowdock.com), and Audio and Screen sharing using HTML5 and Javascript, and [Tmate](https://tmate.io) to share and pair and care. I teach everything from beginner functional and object oriented programming to hands on ruby on rails mentorship to javascript and jquery live instruction.
